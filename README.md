# ABLOMOV-Advanced-BLOck-MOrfometric-and-Volume-analyser-
This Python project is a dedicated, modular solution for the quantitative 3D morphometric analysis of point cloud data, primarily designed for characterizing the size and shape distribution of rock blocks. It implements established geometric methods to derive Convex Hull properties and specific, widely-used morphometric indices
